Create a map that associates email to people.  That is, create a map where the key is a string object and the value is a Person object.

1. Hard code at least 5 elements in this map.
2. Use an iterator to display the entire map, that is, the key and value of each element.


3. Allow the user to type in an email address.
4. Display only the first name associated with that email address.  Say "not in database" if the email is not in the map.
5. Allow the user to search again.
