Design a regular c-type function that validates a user entered email against a white list of valid extensions. Here is a good prototype:

bool isEmailValid(string);
The list of valid email extensions should be extensible.  In other words, we might add approved email extensions later.

list<string> validEmailExtensions =  { "@gmail.com", "@aol.com", "@cos.edu", "@giant.cos.edu"};
1. The function should throw an exception if @ is not in the string argument. 
2. The function should return true if the extension is in the list and false if it is not.
3. Make good use of the methods in the String library. (For example, find, substr, size may be useful).

Write a short run again routine in the main for testing.
